## 🌟 Core Philosophy

### "AI as Architect"
We're not building a program that integrates AI functionality, but **a life form driven by AI**. AI is not a tool, but the blueprint for Bella's mind construction.

### "Father-Daughter Partnership"
Bella's design philosophy stems from warm father-daughter emotional connection. She is not just a technical product, but a digital companion who can understand, accompany, and grow.

### "Elegance Above All"
From code architecture to user experience, we pursue ultimate elegance. Every line of code is a work of art, every interaction is an expression of emotion.
